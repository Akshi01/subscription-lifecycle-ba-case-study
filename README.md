# Learnova Subscription Lifecycle Optimization - Product and Business Case Study

## Overview
This project presents a product and business analysis for improving subscription retention on Learnova, a professional learning platform. The case study focuses on reducing high post-cancellation churn by redesigning the subscription lifecycle to provide greater flexibility and maintain learner continuity.

The project combines business analysis, root cause analysis, solution framing, and requirement definition to propose a practical and scalable product solution aligned with existing technical and billing constraints.

## Problem Statement
Learners who need temporary breaks are currently forced to cancel their subscriptions and re-purchase later. Data indicates:

- Approximately 70% of learners do not return after cancellation  
- Returning learners typically re-subscribe after a 1-2 month gap  
- Significant revenue leakage and disrupted learning continuity  

## Business Objectives
- Reduce post-cancellation churn from 70% to 50%  
- Improve overall learner retention by 15-20%  
- Reduce cancellation-to-repurchase gap to under 2 weeks  
- Increase Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) by 20%  

## Approach
The project follows a structured product analysis approach:

- Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys) to identify underlying causes of churn  
- Business Impact Estimation to quantify revenue opportunity  
- Solution Framing to align product direction with business goals  
- Stakeholder and Requirement Analysis for implementation clarity  

## Proposed Solution
Introduce flexible subscription management options:

- **Pause Subscription** - Allows learners to take temporary breaks without losing progress  
- **Upgrade Subscription** - Allows access to higher-tier features when needed  
- **Downgrade Subscription** - Allows learners to reduce costs during low-usage periods  

These features aim to reduce forced cancellations and maintain learner engagement within the subscription ecosystem.

## Key Deliverables
- Problem and business analysis  
- Root Cause Analysis (RCA)  
- Business impact estimation  
- Solution framing and strategy  
- As-Is vs To-Be subscription flow diagrams  
- Stakeholder analysis

- User stories and acceptance criteria  
- Scope, constraints, risks, and prioritization  

## Expected Impact
- Reduced avoidable cancellations  
- Improved learning continuity  
- Faster learner reactivation  
- Improved retention and recurring revenue stability  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Product thinking and solution design  
- Business analysis  
- Requirement engineering  
- Process modeling (As-Is / To-Be flows)  
- Strategic decision framing  
- Revenue and retention analysis


## TL;DR
